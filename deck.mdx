## First off, the definitions

---

## Marketing

create, grow, maintain, and defend markets

---

## Markets

- a set of customers,
- for a set of products or services,
- common needs or wants,
- and can refer each other (when making decisions)

---

## Customers in a market

- innovators
- early adopters
- early majority
- late majority
- laggards

---

## High tech

What is high tech? What used to be high tech?

Take the electronic car market as an example

- be the first
- number of gas station
- until most people adopted and gas cars diminishes

adoption lifecycle: groups are separated by different _psychological_ profiles

## Market Segments

| Who            | Definition                                                     | Needs                                                                                | Approach                                                                                                       | Example              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Enthusiasts    | appreciate for their own sake                                  | learn, be first, low requirement for other needs                                     | truth and factual, less money, testbed                                                                         | Apple I, optimize.ly |
| Visionaries    | fundamental breakthrough, order or magnitude ROI, recent execs | least price sensitive, buying dream                                                  | productize from enthusiasts needs, be quick (in a hurry), provide ROI                                          | JFK + Moon landing   |
| Early Majority | pragmatists, risk averse, vertically oriented                  | make a percentage of movement, loyal once earned (company standard enforcing)        | full package (product, infra, support, fapiao), few points of control (whom to call when something goes wrong) | Microsoft, SAP       |
| Late Majority  | conservatives, fear of high tech but need to stay on par       | bundled preassembled package, low priced, "consumer tech" with R&D amortized already | focus on convenience > performance, UX > features, sell with early majority                                    | Blackberry           |
| Laggards       | doubts discrepancy between sales and actual product            |                                                                                      |                                                                                                                |                      |

## Early Markets ↔️ Mainstream Markets

enthusiasts ➡️ visionaries: for reviews, reality check

conservatives ➡️ pragmatics: for a good reference check

# The Chasm

![The Chasm revealed](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*GerKOoN7c7TwL6Mcct23uA.png)

---

## The chasm revealed

- visionaries: smarter than majority ↔️ pragmatists: value colleague references in other companies
- visionaries: tech > industry ↔️ pragmatists: present day not future tech
- visionaries: build ground up > infra needed ↔️ pragmatists: the full package
- visionaries: disruptive ego ↔️ pragmatists: they soak up all the budget

# Crossing the Chasm

市场细分，产品准备，定位，分发和定价

---

## D-day Analogy

单点突破，抢滩登陆，扩大市场；不占领诺曼底，就不用考虑巴黎。

be market driven, not sales driven.

create a mainstream market segment that is reference-able. to make the first set of customer totally satisfied: to provide the whole product.

pragmatists buy from market leader, find a niche market, be the market leader.

segment, segment, segment.

then, move to adjacent markets.

例子：salesforce, VMWare, AWS?

---

## Target the Point of Attack

A high risk, low data decision: follow the informed intuition.

checklist:

1. target customer
2. reason to buy
3. whole product
4. partners and allies
5. distribution
6. pricing
7. competition
8. positioning
9. next target

例子：自动售货机，3D printing，drones

---

## Assemble the Invasion Force

define the _whole product_

partners and allies

---

## Define the Battle

高频打低频，优势打劣势，熟悉打陌生

if you can define (choose) the battle then you can win any one.

Box: dropbox for enterprise, replacing sharepoint

Positioning: claim, evidence, communications, feedback and adjustment

---

## Launch the Invasion

_distribution and pricing_

customer-oriented distribution + distribution-oriented pricing
